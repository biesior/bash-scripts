Help for bashtouch.sh ver.: 1.0.2

What it does?
As name suggest it's bash's `touch` version for bash scripts.
It just creates scratch shell script with .sh or .zsh, proper shebang and sample code inside.

You can reuse sample code or remove it and write your own.

Just leave generated shebang.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

Basic syntax:

  bashtouch.sh <filepath><optional-extension> <optional editor>

Where:

  <filepath> is absolute or relative path for new created script, if filename only given it will create script
             in current directory
  <optional-extension> should be one of: .sh, .zsh, .bash for bash script, if none .sh will be added
  <optional editor>  If specified, after creation the file it will be opened in this editor, possibilities:

- Command line editors (if installed):
  vim, nano, jed

- GUI editors on Mac (if installed):
  edit for default OSX editor,
  sublime for OSX Sublime Text.app,
  textedit for OSX TextEdit.app

Samples:

- (optionally)
  cd /path/with/your/executables

- To create script with `bash` shebang
  bashtouch.sh foo.sh

- To create script with `zsh` shebang
  bashtouch.sh bar.zsh

- Auto extension if not given will be .sh:
  bashtouch.sh baz (creates baz.sh)

- Of course you can always use absolute or relative path for new file like:
  bashtouch.sh /full/path/to/zen.sh
  bashtouch.sh ~/in-home-directory.sh
  bashtouch.sh in-current-directory.sh

If for some reason you want/need to use file without extension, just rename it after creation like:
mv new-script.sh new-script

To disable colors permanently:
Just edit the file and set value of DisableColors variable to true.

Have fun :)
