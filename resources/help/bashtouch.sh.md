### What it does?  

As name suggest `touch` version of command for bash scripts.
It just creates scratch shell script with `.sh` or `.zsh`, proper shebang and sample code inside.

You can reuse sample code or remove it and write your own.

Just leave generated shebang.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

### Where  

`<filepath>` is absolute or relative path for new created script, if filename only given it will create script in current directory

`<extension>` should be `.sh` or `.zsh`, if not specified `.sh` will be added automatically.

`<output>` If specified, after creation the file it will be opened in this editor, possibilities:

  ##### Display  

  - `cat` displays generated code in terminal
  - `none` or blank finishes

  ##### Command line editors (if installed)  

  - `vim`
  - `nano`
  - `jed`

  ##### GUI editors on Mac (if installed)  

  - `edit` for default OSX editor
  - `sublime` for OSX Sublime Text.app
  - `textedit` for OSX TextEdit.app

### Samples  

##### (optionally)  

```bash
cd /path/with/your/executables
```

##### To create script with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` 5  

```bash
bashtouch.sh foo.sh
```

##### To create script with `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` 5  
```bash
bashtouch.sh foo.zsh
```

##### If extension is not given. default bash is created:  

`bashtouch.sh baz`  (creates `baz.sh` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang)

##### Of course you can always use absolute or relative path for new file like:  

```bash
bashtouch.sh /full/path/to/zen.sh
bashtouch.sh ~/in-home-directory.sh
bashtouch.sh in-current-directory.sh
```

##### If for some reason you want/need to use file without extension, just rename it after creation like  

```bash
mv new-script.sh new-script
```

### Exported variables  

To modify final output you can export some variables in your shell before executing `bashtouch.sh`
or add selected exports to your profile file.

##### To check current exported variables, just `echo` `one of them in your terminal, like`   
```bash
echo $BASHTOUCH_DEFAULT
```

##### To disable sample body (allowed `true`, `false`):  
```bash
export BASHTOUCH_BODY=false
```

##### To disable generator comment (allowed `true`, `false`):  
```bash
export BASHTOUCH_COMMENT=false
```

##### To disable colored output (allowed `true`, `false`):  
```bash
export BASHTOUCH_COLORS=false
```

##### To set default extension to be used when auto mode  
* required extension must be no-spaces word, starting with dot like `.sh`, `.zsh`, `.my-own-extension`  
* suggested `.sh` or `.zsh`  
* default `.sh`  
```bash
export BASHTOUCH_DEFAULT=.sh
```


##### That's all!  
Now you can run:
```bash
bashtouch.sh have-fun-:-p
```
