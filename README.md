Sample bash scripts to use in linux/unix systems


## Security note  

**Please!** Never use unknown code without checking and understanding it.

## Scripts inside  


## `bashtouch.sh` ver. `1.0.3`

It's where it all begins...

As the name suggests, it is just bash's `touch` variation for bash scripts.


It just creates a scratch shell script with `.sh` or `.zsh` shebang and sample code inside.

You can reuse sample code or remove it and write your own. You can also remove generator comment, but it will be nice if you leave it ;)

Check help section to disable adding of sample body and generator comment permanently with exported variables.
